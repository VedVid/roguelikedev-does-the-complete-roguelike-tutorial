This game is part of r/RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial game jam hosted by /u/aaron_ds on www.reddit/com/r/roguelikedev

I'm using Go programming language (www.golang.org) and BearLibTerminal library (https://bitbucket.org/cfyzium/bearlibterminal/).

I won't learn Git branching just now for game jam, so everything goes to the master.
